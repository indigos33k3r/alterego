Title: Roadmap

Roadmap
=======

These are some of the things that don't work yet, but will, eventually.

 * Reconnect: this is the next high-priority item and should be ready
   very soon;
 * User Avatar: support XEP-0084 - basically it will listen to vCard
   changes (using XEP-0153) and update your avatar nodes;
 * File Transfer: support at least XEP-0065, but I would also like to
   support OOB and IBB;
 * File publishing: support XEP-0214;
 * Ad-hoc commands: support XEP-0050.


User Location plugin
====================

The following improvements will be made to the User Location plugin:

 * warn the user that the current location is unknown;
 * allow the user to browse and update the user location database.

Some form of [Fire Eagle](http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/ "Welcome to Fire Eagle!")
integration is also in the pipeline. Further details soon.
